<p>Lisphys is a small project whose main goal is to experiment with Automatic Differentiation. More precisely, it is a kind of proof of concept that Automatic Differentiation can be used to create complex physics engines. </p>

<p>However, Lisphys want to address the following points:</p>

<ul>
<li>Demonstrate that Automatic Differentiation can ease development of physics engines</li>
<li>Provide a uniform framework to compute all the various derivative used in physics engines : Stiffness, Damping, Jacobian, Velocity, Acceleration, ...</li>
<li>Offer a pedagogic tool to discover physics simulation, by letting learner to experiment by themselves.</li>
</ul><h4>

<p>When you're designing physics engine for multibodies system, two physical properties are important : position and forces.</p>

<p>All the others significant physical properties can be derived from this two ones :</p>

<ul>
<li>Velocity is the time derivative of position : v = dp / dt </li>
<li>Acceleration is the time derivative of velocity, hence, the second time derivative of position :  a = dp / dt^2</li>
<li>Stiffness is the derivative of force with restect to position : k = df/dp</li>
<li>Damping is the the derivative of force with respect to velocity : d = df/dv</li>
<li>Jacobian, as used wot robot control, are the derivative of tge 6D position with respect to the robot degrees of freedom.</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul><p>Hence, if you have a formula to describe the positions and forces of, and have the necessary tools to perform Automatic Differentiation, then it becomes easy to write a time integrator based on euler explicit or implicit methods. </p>

<p>And these remarks also stand for fluid simulation, particules simulation, financial simulation, and so on.</p>

<p>To illustrate the use of Automatic Differentiation to write efficiently and easily physics engine, I've decided to implement a robot simulator.</p>

<p>Our robots are modelized using generelized coordinates and a Lagrangian approach. See <a href="www.mls.org">Murray Ly Sastry</a>.
Hence Lie groups, i.e. SO(3), are used to modelize position, and Lie algebra, so(3) to modelize velicity.</p>
